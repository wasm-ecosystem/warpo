## TS Features

WARPO supports most of well-known TS features

- numeric calculation
- function
- class, interface and polymorphism
- generics

But also misses some features

- `undefined`  
  In script, you can use `null` to totally replace `undefined`.  
  In standard libarary, script will crash in runtime when return value is undefined in TS, e.g. get from non-existed key in map.
- `any`, `unknown`
- prototype
- iterator, for...of, for...in
- closure
- type deduction
